  abstract = {R is rapidly growing in popularity as the environment
                  of choice for data analysis and graphics both in
                  academia and industry.  Lattice brings the proven
                  design of Trellis graphics (originally developed for S
                  by William S. Cleveland and colleagues at Bell Labs)
                  to R, considerably expanding its capabilities in the
                  process.  Lattice is a powerful and elegant high level
                  data visualization system that is sufficient for most
                  everyday graphics needs, yet flexible enough to be
                  easily extended to handle demands of cutting edge
                  research.  Written by the author of the lattice
                  system, this book describes it in considerable depth,
                  beginning with the essentials and systematically
                  delving into specific low levels details as necessary.
                  No prior experience with lattice is required to read
                  the book, although basic familiarity with R is
                  assumed.  The book contains close to 150 figures
                  produced with lattice.  Many of the examples emphasize
                  principles of good graphical design; almost all use
                  real data sets that are publicly available in various
                  R packages.  All code and figures in the book are also
                  available online, along with supplementary material
                  covering more advanced topics.},
